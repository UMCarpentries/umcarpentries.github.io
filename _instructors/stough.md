I'm a microbial ecology postdoc working in Pat Schloss's lab at the University of Michigan Medical School, studying the gut microbiome. As a full-time researcher, I don't have many opportunities to teach as a part of my job, so I joined the Sofware Carpentry Ogansization here at UMich to hone my teaching skills and be a part of the community.
My path to learning computational tools and bioinformatics started in grad school, where I took a class that covered the UNIX shell and a collection of several common bioinofrmatics tools. Since then, I've expanded my experience mostly through small workshops and by teaching myself.

When I'm not in the lab I enjoy reading, writing, and building models. I'm actually using some of the skills I've learned in the Carpentries to add light and sound to models with Arduino boards!
