I'm an Analyst with the BCRF Bioinformatics Core here at the University of Michigan. I came to the "quantitative side" of science in a fairly round-about manner. I was introduced to coding during graduate school, in part through the Carpentries, while transitioning from experimentally driven science (with the model organism *C. elegans*, specifically) to my thesis work, which relied on analyzing large-scale data using the command line, R, and Python. My current position allows me to use my experience at the bench and my computational skills to help design and analyze Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) based experiments. I enjoy working with the Carpentry community as it allows me to help others start their own coding journey while also hopefully breaking down some of the barriers between quantitative and experimental scientists.

When I'm not analyzing data or meeting with researchers, I enjoy expanding our indoor garden, testing new recipes, and spending time with my husband and our little terror of a terrier mix, Theo.
